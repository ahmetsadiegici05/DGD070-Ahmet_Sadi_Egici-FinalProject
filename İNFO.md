Note: I attempted to implement features where the pads change color when touched and a win message appears on the screen when all four pads are touched. However, due to unexpected issues affecting other systems, I wasnâ€™t able to fully implement these features. Instead, I have added debug messages to show that the pad interactions and the win condition when all four pads are touched are working. Thank you for your understanding.
